            <p>👋🏽 Welcome!</p>
            <p>This is the place where I write things, and the place where you should read them. I write about whatever
                I want: which mostly seems to be about logic, technology, politics, and how they intersect.</p>
                <p>Check out my blog, read my about page, or find me on my socials below!</p>
